	<h1><u>Rules:</u></h1>
	<p>You have 3 rolls every turn. Rolling the dice is done simply by clicking the roll button. You can keep or unkeep any of the dice at any time by clicking on them. A red border appears around kept dice. Kept dice will not be rerolled.</p>
	<p>The dice that you have are used to compute your score in each of the categories.</p>
	<p>Basic rules on scoring categories are listed on the scoring card or can be found <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Yahtzee.pdf">HERE</a>.</p>
	<p>You may only score if you have rolled the dice, but otherwise can score at any time (i.e. you do not need to roll all 3 times). You MUST score at the end of 3 rolls, even if that score is 0.</p>
	<p>The score that you would get if you scored in that category is displayed in the "Score This Roll" cell. The scores that you keep are displayed in the "Kept Score".</p>
	<p>The game ends when you have scored all categories. If your score is one of the top 20, you will make it to the high score table!</p>
